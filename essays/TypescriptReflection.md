  When I first learned about Typescript, I wasn't sure what to expect. I have experience with languages like C, C++, and Python, so I felt comfortable with programming fundamentals but wasn't familiar with any script languages. As I was doing the exercises on freeCodeCamp and W3Schools, I learnned that Typescript is a tool that brings structure, clarity, and a sense of order to JavaScript.
  JavaScript is known for its dynamism and lack of strict type enforcement, which is both its strength and weakeness as its rapid prototyping also allows bugs that are hard to trace. TypeScript adds type annotations, interfaces, and more tools to JavaScript, which makes it feel similar to several features of C++ and Python. TypeScript offers the safety of static typing without getting rid of the flexibility developers love about JavaScript. Although my TypeScript experience is limited to a basic quiz and introductory lessons, I have gained an appreciation for some of its feature, specifically type inference. It allows the compiler to deduce variable types without explicit annotations, which creates a balance between safety and convenience. These lessons also introduced me to ES6 features, like destructuring and arrow functions, which are used quite often in TypeScript. While these features are in JavaScript, working with them in TypeScript showed me how they complement the language's focus on more clean and concise code
  From my perspective, TypeScript is definitely a valuable language as its static typing prevents countless bugs, while its integration with modern IDEs enhances productivity through features like autocomplete and real-time error checking. This makes it a great option for large projects where code maintainability and collaboration are an important factor. However, since setting up TypeScript in a project requires configuration and transpiling into JavaScript which adds an extra step to the developmment process, I don't believe it is a sufficient choice for smaller projects and quick prototypes as this overhead might not feel justified. Overall, the choice to use TypeScript does depend on the context. 
  

## What do you think about Typescript so far?

My first impressions of TypeScript are mixed. I think it's a little better than JavaScript, which I have explored through basic lessons on freeCodeCamp, since its static typing is a little more user-friendly. I have experience in both C++ and Python, and this feature reminds me of the newer versions of these languages' optional typing features, which help with reducing runtime errors. Something I don't enjoy is some of its syntax (i.e. '==='), as it felt weirdly complex, especially my first time learning it.

## Did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6?

Although I only took a basic quiz on TypeScript, it introduced me to concepts like type annotations and type inference. I also learned some ES6 features, such as arrow functions and destructuring, but with additional type-checking capabilities. It showed me that TypeScript offers the flexibility of JavaScript while giving tools to prevent common bugs. I feel that TypeScript is
